# Problem 4: Three ways to sum to n
> Just so you know, this is my favourite question in leetcode, even though it's categorised as "Easy". The reason is, it demonstrate how beauty a Mathematical can help simplify a function dramatically.



### Method 1: For Loop

- Time Complexity: `O(n)`
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`

### Method 2: Recursive

- Time Complexity: `O(n)`
- Space Complexity: `O(n)`

### Method 3: Mathematical formula

- Time Complexity: `O(1)`
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`
